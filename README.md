Global Game Jam 2018 Entry: Based on true events, you play as the "Area 51 Caller" from the infamous September 11th, 1997 broadcast of Art Bell's "Coast To Coast AM". You've just told the world the truth, and now the forces you sought to expose have you surrounded. Trapped in a small Arizona town in the grip of a supernatural blackout, you must make your way past inter-dimensional creatures armed with nothing but a taser and a handheld radio. Keep track of alien radio transmissions to sneak past your hunters as you try to make your escape from the town. Fail, and the truth dies with you.
